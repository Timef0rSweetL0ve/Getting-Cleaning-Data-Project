Data Experiment Information:
----------------------------

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and
gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain
signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of
50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low
pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove
noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body
and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ)
using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3
Hz.

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were
derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional
signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag,
tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag).

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these
signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ,
fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to
indicate frequency domain signals).
